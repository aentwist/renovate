Lint code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). To help with this, a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration is provided.

I recommend installing pre-commit using pip. If you want to install it in a venv, use the path `.venv`.

```shell
pip install pre-commit==3.5.0
```

Then install the Git hooks using pre-commit.

```shell
pre-commit install
```
